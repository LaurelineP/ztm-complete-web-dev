# 01 HTML BY PRACTICE
**<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>** is the **skeleton** of any web page.  
It allows to **structure semantically** a page content  
*(specially since HTML5 with major semantic improvement)*.

<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is used in combination of **<abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>**,  
to style how the HTML elements are displayed,   
and **<abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>**, a scripting language allowing to create extra interactions with the web site.
- CSS: would be the skin on the HTML skeleton
- JS: would be the muscles on the HTML skeleton

## Personal challenge/objective/motivation:
*This is a personal initiative not included in the lessons*
Knowing HTML, this is a good opportunity to take the time to create
a project to document and explain the fundamentals gathered  
with more advanced programming concepts and good practice: 
- <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY<abbr>: by avoiding code repetition (to apply on HTML)
- <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">SOC<abbr>: separation of concerns by organizing the
project structure (tree)

Questioning it may answer: How to organize efficiently an HTML based project?


### Project
- build a project explaining how HTML CSS and JS work together
- apply DRY concept if possible: ("componentifying" HTML if/when possible)
