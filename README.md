# [PROJECT LIVE](https://laurelinep.github.io/ztm-complete-web-dev_doc-along/)

## Personal challenge/objective/motivation:

_This is a personal initiative not included in the lessons_ Knowing HTML, this is a good opportunity to take the time to create a project to document and explain the fundamentals gathered  
with more advanced programming concepts and good practice:

-   <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY<abbr>: by avoiding code repetition (to apply on HTML)
-   <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">SOC<abbr>: separation of concerns by organizing the project structure (tree)

Questioning it may answer: How to organize efficiently an HTML based project?

### Project

-   build a project :
    -   explaining/documenting the course content
    -   centralized downloadable content
    -   have a creative mind to present the content\
        _Example: how to integrate all course exercises/practice in the project_
-   apply DRY concept if possible: ("componentifying" HTML if/when possible)

    # 01 HTML

    **<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>** is the **skeleton** of any web page.  
    It allows to **structure semantically** a page content  
    _(specially since HTML5 with major semantic improvement)_.

<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is used in combination of **<abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>**,  
to style how the HTML elements are displayed,  
and **<abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>**, a scripting language allowing to create extra interactions with the web site.

-   CSS: would be the skin on the HTML skeleton
-   JS: would be the muscles on the HTML skeleton


    # 02 CSS

    **<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>** is like the **skin, clothes, visual accessories** for a web page.  
    It allows to **style**,**animate**, **add visual effects** to a page content skeleton

    # 03 JS
    **<abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>** represents the **logic** and **muscles** for a web page.  
    It allows to enhance the user experience interactions / counter native browser behavior regarding
    updating the page content, logically build HTML content using JS


### Course progression demonstration
The purpose of this project is also to share the skills progressions per major topics covered.
Each presented topic ( project navigation list ) demonstrate what could be done with the topic
The site content reflecting the course progression
covered and how this Documenting project looks like
